📊 Data Analytics Project

**Overview**
This project demonstrates an end-to-end **Data Analytics workflow**, starting from raw data ingestion to insight generation and business-ready visualization. The objective is to analyze the dataset, extract meaningful insights using Python and SQL, and present them through an interactive Power BI dashboard along with a professional report and presentation.

## 📂 Dataset

* The dataset is loaded using **Python**
* Contains structured data suitable for exploratory analysis and business insights
* Data includes multiple attributes used for analysis, aggregation, and visualization
  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **Python** – Data loading, cleaning, and EDA
* **Libraries** – Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **PostgreSQL** – Data storage and SQL querying
* **SQL** – Data extraction, filtering, joins, aggregations
* **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard creation
* **Gamma** – Report and PPT creation

## 🔄 Project Workflow / Steps

### 1. Data Loading

* Imported the dataset into Python using Pandas
* Performed initial inspection (shape, data types, missing values)

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Univariate and multivariate analysis
* Distribution analysis and trend identification
* Visualizations using charts and plots

### 3. Data Cleaning

* Handled missing values
* Removed duplicates
* Corrected data types
* Standardized column names and values

### 4. Database & SQL Analysis

* Created tables in **PostgreSQL**
* Loaded cleaned data into the database
* Executed SQL queries for:

  * Aggregations
  * Filtering and sorting
  * Business-driven insights

### 5. Dashboard Development

* Connected PostgreSQL data to **Power BI**
* Built an interactive dashboard with:

  * KPIs
  * Filters and slicers
  * Trend and comparison charts

### 6. Reporting & Presentation

* Created a structured **analysis report**
* Designed a professional **presentation (PPT)** using Gamma
* Focused on insights, trends, and actionable outcomes
